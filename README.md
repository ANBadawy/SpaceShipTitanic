# Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition


## Introduction

The Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition tasks participants with leveraging their data science and machine learning skills to make predictions about a spaceship's voyage. The competition dataset contains various features related to the spaceship's systems and performance, and the goal is to develop predictive models that can provide valuable insights.

## Getting Started

To begin participating in the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition, follow these steps:

#### Dependencies

- Check the list the libraries and packages used for analysis and modeling.

1. ### **Data Processing**:
   #### Data Inspection
   - Summarize the initial exploration of the dataset.
   - Mention any observations about the data's structure, content, or quality.

   #### Data Cleaning
    - Describe how missing data was handled (removal, imputation, interpolation, etc.).
    - Explain how outliers and data errors were addressed.
     
    #### Data Transformation
    - Document any data type conversions and reasons behind them.
    - Mention if scaling, normalization, or encoding techniques were applied.
    - Describe any feature engineering done to create new features.
     
    #### Data Splitting

    - Explain how the dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets.
    - Provide the ratio or size of each split.
  

2. ### **Analysis and Modeling**:
   #### Model Training

    - Document the process of training the machine learning models.
    - Include hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and evaluation metrics used.
    #### Model Evaluation

    - Describe the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, etc.).
    - Present the results of model evaluations, including any visualizations or tables.


3. ### **Review**:
   #### Results and Conclusions

    - Summarize the key findings from the analysis and modeling.
    - Discuss the implications of the results and how they address the project objectives.
