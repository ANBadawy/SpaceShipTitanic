# Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition


## Introduction

The Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition tasks participants with leveraging their data science and machine learning skills to make predictions about a spaceship's voyage. The competition dataset contains various features related to the spaceship's systems and performance, and the goal is to develop predictive models that can provide valuable insights.

## Getting Started

To begin participating in the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition, follow these steps:

#### Dependencies

- Check the list the libraries and packages used for analysis and modeling.

1. ### **Data Processing**:
   #### Data Inspection
   - Summarizing the initial exploration of the dataset.
   - Mentioned some observations about the data's structure in the notebook.

   #### Data Cleaning
    - Showing how missing data was handled (removal, imputation, interpolation, etc.).
     
    #### Data Transformation
    - Used standard scalar (Hot One Encoding was applied).
     
    #### Data Splitting

    - the dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets.
  

2. ### **Analysis and Modeling**:
   #### Model Training

    - Used Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier in the process of training.

    #### Model Evaluation

    - Used the evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) to assess model performance.
    - Presented the results of model evaluations, including some visualizations and tables.


3. ### **Review**:
   #### Results and Conclusions

    - The Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition was a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my data science skills, tackle a challenging problem, and learn from the       global data science community. While the competition has concluded, the knowledge and insights gained will continue to benefit our future projects. I look forward to          applying what I've learned to new data challenges and further advancing my data science journey.
